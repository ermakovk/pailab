# AIthing
AIthing is an open source platform to version, analyze and automatize your machine learning model building processes and deployments.
It keeps track of changes in your machine learning pipeline (code, data, parameters) similar to classical 
version control systems considering special characteristics of ai model building processes. AIthing offers tools to analyze models and their changes,
automated testing, quality checks and methods to boost your models such as hyperparameter optimization.

AIthing tries to offer an interface which makes it easy to plugin new models or frameworks and initialy comes with support for scikit learn and tensorflow.
